  <h1> Welcome to Belfast</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Belfast! For a relatively small place, Belfast sure has had a rocky and interesting history: once the thriving capital of the Industrial Revolution, it was home to the world’s biggest shipyards, linen mills and tobacco factories. RMS Titanic, arguably the most famous ship in the world, was born here; then came the The Troubles, a turbulent period synonymous with violence and unrest. Belfast has it all
  </p>    <!-- adds paragraph to web page -->
  <p>
  The Belfast of today is a completely different place – it’s become a vibrant travel destination. lt leans hard into the Titanic connection, with a stately museum plus a range of cruises and walking tours dedicated to the tragic shipwreck. For non-history buffs, the city offers other delightful attractions, from food markets to pub crawls.
