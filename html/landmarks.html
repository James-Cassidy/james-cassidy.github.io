  Limelight in Belfast, Northern Ireland is mid-sized live music and night club venue complex, which initially opened in 1987. The complex on the city's Ormeau Avenue consists of Limelight 1 & Limelight 2, as well as a bar called Katy's Bar. The outdoor terrace is called The Rock Garden.
  Limelight has strong associations with new bands, homegrown talent, and indie/rock/metal club nights.

	Fresh garbage first opened its doors in Bank Street in 1969 and has been a Mecca for youth culture ever since. Renowned for being at the cutting edge of alternative fashion and street fashion, this distinctive shop merits mention in many international guides as well as The Lonely Planet. It has something for everybody and the heady mix of incense and music make any visit to Fresh Garbage an experience.
